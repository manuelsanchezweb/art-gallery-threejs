# 3D Art Gallery Tutorial using Three.js + TypeScript

</div>

This is a project I realized by extending [Emilian Kasemi's tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfMizAmPprs). My goal was to deep in the basics of Three.js so that I could create interactive projects.

## Installation

You need Node.js installed on your computer.
If you have any problem with the version, with 18 you should not have any problem.

```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
